who all backed away from her completely unaware of where shed come from - and she leapt off the edge of the land after the child however life in a single room left her wings largely useless and while she caught the child she couldnt actually fly rather the best she could do was slow her falling the landing was still harsh and painful but the both managed to survive she landed in a small farming village where the people were familiar with her kingdoms ritual - as they ended up being the ones burying the banished - but this was the first time theyd ever seen one with black wings as old as kaminari the told her all about the ritual and showed her the cemetery where the hundreds of black winged children rested they told her they didnt know who she was but she must have been important to have survived up there as long as she had kaminari felt horrible she couldnt rationalize that she could possibly be so much more important than hundreds of others just like her the way she saw it they died for her and being the gentle soul she was kaminari swore that she would save someone in honor of each grave present and someday make her way back to the place of her birth to right this awful practice with that she left the village on a journey to find and help others in need even though she was the only one on the surface world with wings (black or otherwise) and she knew nothing of any society outside books from there kaminari eventually meets up with three companions first theres hokori an extremely skilled swordsman traveling the world to find and collect the seven legendary blades to become stronger after failing to protect someone important to him although he becomes a loyal ally as the story progressees he actually starts out as an enemy hokori almost betrays her very early on thinking he could use her to get into toria where one of the ledendary blades is said to be located then theres aneko who was born into high society although wealthy she never felt comfortable at home her family expected her to be a lot of things that didnt come naturally to her all aneko really wanted was freedom to live how she pleased so she started training with a sword right under her familys noses she did so for quite some time until she finaly left without a word now she lives on her own as a formidable mercenary or at least she did until she met kaminari they became fast friends and aneko took interest in kaminaris quest as well as her freedom to go wherever and finaly theres rei a young wizard boy at first he seems like comic relief since hes hyper and never takes things seriously but it turns out hes pretty tragic despite warnings from everyone close to him he opens a magic book he was forbidden from going near it unleashes a terrible curse on his entire village leaving it in ruin rei wanders for a while hiding his woes behind a smile and quick jokes but follows kaminari after watching her help another village he wonders if maybe she could save his too all of kaminaris companions are different but they share both her knowledge of what its like to feel different and outcast as well as her interest in doing whats right for people so the story takes off in this open-ended adventure with the crew traveling around to different places getting caught up in different situations and helping wherever they can and its all very exciting and interesting and i just love it so much"},
